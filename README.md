# Canada Covid-19 Vaccination Rates

A backwards looking simple projection based on the shared provincial
vaccination rates published and shared by the <a href="https://github.com/ccodwg/Covid19Canada">
COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group</a>.

## How's it work?

Data is pulled from the <a href="https://github.com/ccodwg/Covid19Canada">
CCODWG Github Page</a> and is manipulated by some simple javascript. These
projections are kludgey. They are only based on the rolling average of
vaccination rates over the past two weeks, the 2020 Canadian census
population data, 2 doses per person, and the number of people currently
vaccinated. <b>These numbers do not account for any uptick in vaccination
rate, which will hopefully happen</b>. They are meant to show how we're
doing, and to encourage people to reach out to their MP and MPP and talk
about why we need to do this faster.

## Your math is wrong! This is all wrong! Fix it!

You're probably right! This page is hosted by github. You can <a href="https://github.com/minasmart/canada-covid-vaccine-rate.github.io">

## Warranties

There are none. This is bad math. Don't trust it. Do your own research and
calculations. The data here is presented with no warranties or guarantees
in regard to accuracy or representation.
