# canada-covid-vaccine-rate.github.io

I got really bored so I built a COVID vaccine tracker for Canada showing how long it'll take for us to get vaccinated. My math might be kind bad, but it looks okay from here.

The math in here is based on 2 doses per person.

Province populations are static based on 2020 census data.

Covid-19 administration data is pulled from [here](https://github.com/ccodwg/Covid19Canada).

This whole thing is built with NO WARRANTY OR GUARANTEES! I mostly wanted to see if I could learn vue in a rudimentary way while I was sorta under the weather.
